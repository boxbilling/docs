* Distribute your software at the same time (you don’t need to upload your downloadable products anywhere else).
* You can license as many different applications as you want. There are no limits on either the number of clients you can have or licenses you can issue.
* Each license can be attached to specific IPs, domain names, email addresses, software installation paths. These details can be saved when application first calls BoxBilling or your client can specify these values during signup. If application will later call from a different IP, domain or email system will return “license invalid” error. You can modify any of these values later, or allow dynamic IPs, domains, installation paths etc. to work for the same license key.
